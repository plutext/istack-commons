	<a href="https://jaxb.dev.java.net/">JAXB</a>,
	<a href="https://saaj.dev.java.net/">SAAJ</a>, and
	<a href="https://jax-ws.dev.java.net/">JAX-WS</a> projects
	are often used together by other projects (such as 
	<a href="https://mustang.dev.java.net/">Mustang</a>,
	<a href="https://glassfish.dev.java.net/">Glassfish</a>, and
	<a href="https://jwsdp.dev.java.net/">JWSDP</a> to name a few.)
	
	But at the same time, they are released independently, and those technolgoies don't necessarily have
	dependencies between them. 

<p>
	To promote code reuse between these projects, we host the common part in a separate project,
	so that when we ship individually, we can each carry <tt>istack-commons.jar</tt>, and
	when e deliver together into another technology, we can reduce the footprint.
